## Recommendations

### 1. Improve Fulfillment for Top Categories
> Prioritize logistics partnerships and SLA enforcement for Food & Beverage and Home Goods categories. These drive revenue but suffer fulfillment gaps.

### 2. Incentivize Prepaid Deliveries
> Delivered orders generate higher AOV. Redesign the checkout flow to highlight trust signals, offer delivery guarantees, or discounts for prepaid orders.
